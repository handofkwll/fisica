###The FISICA Project

FISICA stands for 'Far Infra-red Space Interferometer Critical Assessment': 
Scientific Definition and Technology Development for the Next Generation 
THz Space Interferometer

The project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Seventh Programme 
for research, technological development and demonstration under Grant 
agreement No 312818 - FISICA.

The project is funded for three years, starting January 2013.

###pyfiins

As part of the FISICA project a python program is being written to simulate 
the data taken by a 'strawman design' double Fourier interferometer in space.
This program is called **pyfiins**.

Currently, it is run from IPython (see ipython.org) built on python 2.7 on a 
Mac.

###Installation

This describes the installation procedure for a Mac. We will attempt to automate
the installation process in the near future and make sure that it works for
other OS.

1. Follow ipython.org/install instructions to install Anaconda and then use 
that to install IPython and the other modules needed:

  * numpy (for fast array processing)
  * scipy (scientific functions and constants)
  * matplotlib (for plotting) 
  * parallelpython (for parallel processing)
 
  If the installation has worked then you should be able to type ipython, then:

  * In [1]: import numpy
  * In [2]: import scipy
  * In [3]: import matplotlib
  * In [4]: import pp

  with no errors.

2. Check out the code from GitHub, install it in a fresh directory.

3. Create a different 'working' directory to run the simulator from
and copy the .xlsx files from fisica/excel into it - that is where 
the code will look for them.

4. Start up python then:

  tell python where to look for the code and 'import' it

  * In [1]: import sys
  * In [2]: sys.path.append('/users/jfl/fisica')
  * In [3]: import pyfiins

  construct the simulator specifying a file describing the sky model 
  to use

  * In [4]: f=pyfiins.PyFIInS(sky_file='SkyTest.xlsx', sky_sheet='Master')
  * In [5]: f.simulate()

  It should run for 50 minutes or so, producing lots of debug statements 
  and a few 'warnings', eventually finishing with:

  * .....
  * rendering observe
  * rendering writefits

  If it has worked then you should see a new directory in your working 
  directory with name of form 'fisisca-sim-yyyymmddThhmmss', which contains 
  the browsable weblog for the run just made, and a file with name of
  form 'yyyymmddThhmmss.fits' that contains the simulated interferograms
  in a FITS table. 

  Point your browser to the weblog, scroll down to the bottom and click on 
  'uvmapgenerator.html' whereupon the navigable weblog display should appear.

  To reduce the interferograms go into python once again and repeat the
  above commands until the point where you import pyfiins where you should 
  instead do:

  * In [4]: import pydataprocessing
  * In [5]: d=pydataprocessing.PyDataProcessing('20150519T131215.fits')

  giving the name of the FITS file generated by the simulator.

  * In [6]: d.reduce()

  After a further 10 minutes or so, the program will finish with:

  * ...
  * rendering reduceinterferogram
  * rendering dirtyimage

  A weblog describing the reduction results will appear in
  'fisica-dp-yyyymmddThhmmss'.
