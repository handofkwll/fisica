###The FISICA Project

FISICA stands for 'Far Infra-red Space Interferometer Critical Assessment': 
Scientific Definition and Technology Development for the Next Generation 
THz Space Interferometer

The project received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Seventh Programme 
for research, technological development and demonstration under Grant 
agreement No 312818 - FISICA.

The project was funded for three years, starting January 2013.

###pyfiins

As part of the FISICA project a python program is was written to simulate 
the data taken by a 'strawman design' double Fourier interferometer in space.
This program is called **pyfiins**.

Currently, it is run from IPython (see ipython.org) built on python 2.7 on a 
Mac.

###Installation

To run the simulator you will need a Python installation with the following
modules available for import (version numbers of my currently working 
installation in square brackets):

  * astropy (.io.pyfits used for FITS file access) [1.0.3]
  * matplotlib (for plotting) [1.4.3]
  * numpy (for fast array processing) [1.9.2]
  * parallelpython (for parallel processing) [1.6.4]
  * psutil (system utilities) [ 2.2.1]
  * scipy (scientific functions and constants) [0.15.1]
  * xlrd (for access to Excel files) [0.9.3]

Your python installation is suitable if you can start it up and type:

  * In [1]: import astropy.io.fits
  * In [2]: import matplotlib
  * In [3]: import numpy
  * In [4]: import pp
  * In [5]: import psutil
  * In [6]: import scipy
  * In [7]: import xlrd

with no errors.

If you have a Mac with no pre-existing python then follow 
ipython.org/install instructions to install Anaconda and then use 
it to install IPython and all the necessary modules that it can.
'pp' or parallelpython may not be known to Anaconda so you should install it
following the installation instructions at www.parallelpython.com

Once you have a working Python installation you should follow
the following procedure to install the simulator:

1. Check out the code from GitHub, install it in a fresh directory.

2. Create a different 'working' directory to run the simulator from
and copy the .xlsx files from fisica/excel into it - that is where 
the code will look for them. In addition, 'gunzip' 
fisica/data/ringcube.fits.gz and copy that into the working
directory.

3. Start up python then:

  tell python where to look for the code and 'import' it

  * In [1]: import sys
  * In [2]: sys.path.append('\*your code directory\*/fisica')
  * In [3]: import pyfiins

  construct the simulator specifying a file with the sky model 
  to use, and indicating where the beam models can be found
  (relative to the working directory)

  * In [4]: f=pyfiins.PyFIInS(sky_file='ringcube.fits', beam_model_dir='../fisica/beam_models/Smooth_Walled_Horn/Band 4 GRASP')
  * In [5]: f.simulate()

  It should run for 150 minutes or so, eventually finishing with:

  * .....
  * rendering observe
  * rendering writefits

  Note that at the rendering stage there is often a warning of 
  'tight_layout: falling back to Agg renderer'. It is harmless.

  If it has worked then you should see a new directory in your working 
  directory with name of form 'fisica-sim-yyyymmddThhmmss', which contains 
  the browsable weblog for the run just made, and a file with name of
  form 'yyyymmddThhmmss.fits' that contains the simulated interferograms
  in a FITS table. 

  Point your browser to the weblog, scroll down to the bottom and click on 
  'uvmapgenerator.html' whereupon the navigable weblog display should appear.

  To reduce the interferograms go into python once again and repeat the
  above commands until the point where you import pyfiins where you should 
  instead do:

  * In [4]: import pydataprocessing
  * In [5]: d=pydataprocessing.PyDataProcessing('20150519T131215.fits', data_quality='pure')

  giving the name of the FITS file generated by the simulator.

  * In [6]: d.reduce()

  After a further 30 minutes or so, the program will finish with:

  * ...
  * rendering reduceinterferogram
  * rendering dirtyimage

  A weblog describing the reduction results will appear in
  'fisica-dp-yyyymmddThhmmss'.
